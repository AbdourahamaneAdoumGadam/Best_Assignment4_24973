1. What is Logging?

   Write a brief explanation of what logging is in the context of software development:
 
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. This can include informational messages, warnings, errors, and other significant events. Logs are essential for monitoring the behavior of applications, diagnosing issues, and understanding application flow.

2. Why Logging is Important

Discuss the importance of logging, covering aspects such as debugging, monitoring, security, and maintenance:

•	Debugging and Troubleshooting: Helps identify and fix errors or bugs.
•	Monitoring: Provides insights into application performance and usage.
•	Audit Trails: Maintains a record of user activities and system events.
•	Security: Detects and investigates security incidents.
•	Maintenance: Assists in maintaining the application over time by providing historical context.


3. Understanding Logging Levels

   Explain the different logging levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) and their appropriate use cases:

Logging levels indicate the severity or importance of the messages being logged. Common logging levels include:
•	TRACE: Fine-grained details of the application flow.
•	DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging purposes.
•	INFO: Informational messages highlighting the progress of the application.
•	WARN: Potentially harmful situations.
•	ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
•	FATAL: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
